            in the country, AIIMS Delhi Director Dr Randeep Guleria on Thursday said that it is not possible to vaccinate everyone in India in the

            Results Likely in Late-January: Report Saying that vaccines in India are in their final trial stage, he expressed hope that by the end

            vaccine, no significant serious adverse effects seen. Data shows that in the short term vaccine is safe,” Guleria added.
            He further added that the work is going on at war-footing both at Centre and state level for vaccine distribution plan in terms of 
            maintaining cold chain, having appropriate storehouses available, developing  strategy, training vaccinators and availability of syringes.
            “Once booster dose is given, vaccine will give good amount of anti-body production and will start giving protection. This will last 
            for many months giving protection for a significant time when numbers will be less. We need to see type of immunity vaccine gives,” Guleria 
            added. Talking about the current wave of coronavirus, he said that now there is a decline in current wave and he hoped that this will 
            continue if all are able to have a good COVID-19 appropriate behaviour.Giving details about Chennai trial case, he said that it was an 
            incidental finding rather than related to vaccine. “When we vaccinate a large number of people, some of them may have some other disease, 
            which may not be related to vaccine,” he said.</p>

            birth anniversarys</h3>Former India cricketer Sachin Tendulkar remembered his childhood coach Ramakant Achrekar and paid an emotional 
            tribute on his birth anniversary. The legendary batsman on Thursday shared an old picture in which coach Achrekar can be seen guiding 
            the former cricketer on how to hold a cricket bat. Tendulkar took a trip down memory lane and penned an emotional note thanking his 
            coach for helping him and other cricketers realise their potential. “Thinking of a person very close to my heart who helped countless 
            young cricketers, including me, to realise their potential through the power of sport & character. Thank you for everything, Achrekar Sir,” 
            Tendulkar tweeted. The stalwart coach passed away at the age of 87 on January 2 last year. Upon Achrekar’s death, Tendulkar said that 
            his childhood coach had built the foundation of the master blaster’s cricketing career. “Cricket in heaven will be enriched with the 
            presence of Achrekar Sir. Like many of his students, I learnt my ABCD of cricket under Sir’s guidance. His contribution to my life cannot 
            be captured in words. He built the foundation that I stand on,” Tendulkar had said. Regarded as one of the greatest batsmen ever, Tendulkar 
            holds the record of being the highest run-scorer of all time in international cricket, having notched up 18,426 runs in ODIs and 15,921 
            runs in Test matches.</p>

            ODI by 13 runs, the Indian cricket team will head into the T20Is full of confidence. The first of the three T20Is takes place at the Manuka 
            Oval in Canberra on Friday, and former India captain Sunil Gavaskar believes India should stick with Kuldeep Yadav for the T20I opener after 
            his fine show on Wednesday.“Kuldeep showed good rhythm. He bowled after long time. I think at least for the first T20 International, he can 
            be tried out and see how it goes,” Gavaskar told India Today. “(If) Hardik will bowl a couple of overs in the T20 format and that will ease 
            the load on other bowlers and also create more options for Kohli.”Gavaskar, the first batsman to score 10000 runs in Tests, also weighed in 
            on India’s opening pair, believing that KL Rahul should open the batting along with Shikhar Dhawan. Rahul has been batting at No. 5 for 
            India, but as per Gavaskar, both batsman – who were the two highest run-scorers in the IPL (Orange Cap winner Rahul with 670 runs for Kings 
            XI Punjab and Dhawan wit 618 runs for Delhi Capitals) are best suited to begin proceedings for India in the T20Is.“For me, KL Rahul, who 
            scored nearly 700 runs in IPL and Shikhar Dhawan, who has of late looked most comfortable in T20 format should open the innings followed 
            by Virat Kohli. “If they stay till 14th or 15th over, then Hardik Pandya comes in at number four or if two wickets go in Powerplay, then 
            Shreyas Iyer,” Gavaskar said.</p>
